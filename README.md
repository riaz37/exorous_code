# Exorous Code

A professional AI coding agent that can execute tasks using tools and manage complex development workflows.

## Installation

Install directly from the source:

```bash
pip install .
```

Or if you are developing:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

Start the interactive coding agent:

```bash

```

On the first run, Exorous will prompt you to:
1. Select your preferred LLM provider (OpenRouter, OpenAI, Anthropic, or Gemini).
2. Enter your API key for the selected provider.

Alternatively, run a single prompt:

```bash
